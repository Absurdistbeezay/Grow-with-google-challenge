			<p>Dogs are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by
				humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.Today, some dogs are used as pets, others
				are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen
				to humans. Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets.
