			<p>Dogs
				<i>(Canis lupus familiaris)</i> are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves.
				They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.Today, some dogs are
				used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful,
				friendly, loyal and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets. Dogs eat both
				meat and vegetables, often mixed together and sold in stores as dog food. Dogs often have jobs, including as police dogs,
				army dogs, assistance dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue dogs.
